80-89%          | Very reliable   | Minimal review needed
70-79%          | Generally reliable | Spot check key results  
60-69%          | Needs review    | Manual validation
<60%            | Uncertain       | Detailed review required
```

#### Business Decision Framework
```
Priority Matrix for Issues:
High Impact + High Frequency = Immediate Action
High Impact + Low Frequency = Monitor Closely  
Low Impact + High Frequency = Process Improvement
Low Impact + Low Frequency = Note for Reference
```
