# Frontend Documentation

The Personal Paraguay Fiber Comments Analysis System uses **Streamlit** as its primary frontend framework, providing an interactive web-based interface for customer comment analysis.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Streamlit (Python-based web framework)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with theming system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state

### Core Components
The frontend is organized into modular components for maintainability and reusability:

```
src/components/
├── analysis_dashboard_ui.py          # Main analysis interface
├── analysis_results_ui.py            # Results display component
├── cost_optimization_ui.py           # Cost monitoring interface
├── enhanced_results_ui.py            # Advanced results visualization
├── file_upload_ui.py                 # File upload component
├── optimized_file_upload_ui.py       # Performance-optimized upload

## 🔧 Component Development

### Component Structure
Each UI component follows a consistent structure:

```python
def component_name():
    """
    Component description and purpose
    
    Returns:
        Any return values or state changes
    """
    # Component implementation
    pass
```
